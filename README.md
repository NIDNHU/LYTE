## Commands

### !queue

The default command to queue a song is `!queue <VIDEO_ID>`, where `<VIDEO_ID>` is the ID for the youtube music video (everything after `?v=`). The command listener (default `!`) and command (default `queue`) can be changed in the [config](#config-documentation) if desired.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>By default, this command only works with IDs of videos that are on YouTube Music; regular videos will not download. This is because youtube likes to block links in comments and chat to prevent self-promotion, or something.

> [!WARNING]
> This Program is known to not work on linux, I am working on this but it is not my main priority, if you have gotten it to work on linux without removing any functionality you can create a PR and I will review it.

## Setup

### EXE installation:
1. Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/NIDNHU/YTLM/releases/tag/release)'s .exe file to any folder on your computer (this is because the .exe will create files upon execution)
2. If not installed already, install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, please make sure the box at the bottom labelled "add Python.exe to PATH" is ticked
3. Check whether pip was added to Path correctly by running `pip install --upgrade pip` in terminal; this will both make sure pip is correctly installed and that it is up-to-date
4. Run the `LYTE.exe` file located in whatever folder you saved the release to.

> If you are using windows, a popup may appear stating that "Windows Protected Your PC." if you trust this program, click "More info" then "Run anyway"
5. In the window that opened, change `LIVESTREAM_ID` to the ID of your live stream (Ie, the characters at the end of the URL, after the `?v=`)
6. *OPTIONAL*: change the other configs, documentation can be found in [Config Documentation](#config-documentation)
7. Press "Save and Start"
