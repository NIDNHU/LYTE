# YTLM
YouTube Live Music  (YTLM) is a bot i coded (with the help of AI) that allows viewers of a livestream to use commands to queue music

# SETUP
1- Clone/Download and extract the Repo to any folder on your computer

2- Run the file "PipInstall.bat"

3- Open the file "config.json" in your text editor of choice, I reccomend [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.6.7/)

4- Change "YOUR_LIVESTREAM_ID" to the ID of your livestream (Ie. the characters at the end of the URL, after the "/live/")

5- Change the value for "RATE_LIMIT_SECONDS" this defaults to 600 and is how long users have to wait before they can request another song (in seconds)

6- Run main.py

7- Done!
