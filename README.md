# YTLM
YouTube Live Music  (YTLM) is a stupid little bot I coded (with a little help from AI) that allows viewers of a live stream to use commands to queue music

## Commands

### !queue

The command to queue a song is "!queue \<VIDEO\_ID>" where \<VIDEO\_ID> is the unique string of characters used to identify a video (everything after the "v=")&#x20;

> [!IMPORTANT]
>THIS COMMAND ONLY WORKS WITH IDs OF VIDEOS THAT ARE ON YOUTUBE MUSIC, REGULAR VIDEOS WILL NOT DOWNLOAD

## Setup

1. Download and extract the source to any folder on your computer (clone repo or download [latest release](https://github.com/NIDNHU/YTLM/releases/tag/release))
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, please make sure the box at the bottom labelled "add Python.exe to PATH" is ticked
3. Check pip was added to path correctly by running `pip install --upgrade pip`, this will both make sure pip is correctly installed and that it is up-to-date
4. Install the required python libraries (found in Src/requirements.txt) using pip (normally included in Python)
5. Install [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) for your computer appropiately.
6. Download the correct version, extract it and navigate to the bin folder
[Windows FFmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip)
[MacOS FFmpeg](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-7.1.1.zip"). Ignore the next step; put the default path into the JSON.
Linux FFmpeg: Use your package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install ffmpeg` or `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg`). Ignore the next step; put the default path into the JSON.
8. (Windows ONLY) Move everything from the bin folder to src/ffmpeg and then delete the placeholder file "DELETEME".
9. Locate the path of the VLC media player, generally found in "C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC" or "C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC"
10. Open the file "config.json" in your text editor of choice, I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.6.7/)
11. Change "YOUR\_LIVESTREAM\_ID" to the ID of your live stream (Ie. the characters at the end of the URL, after the "/live/")
12. Change the value for "RATE\_LIMIT\_SECONDS". This defaults to 600 and is how long users have to wait before they can request another song (in seconds)
13. Replace "PATH\_TO\_VLC\_HERE" with the path to your VLC&#x20;
14. Run main.py and VLC will open.

> [!CAUTION]
>__ON WINDOWS, USE DOUBLE BACKSLASHES INSTEAD OF SINGLE, `C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC` MUST BECOME `C:\\\Program Files\\\VideoLAN\\\VLC\\\vlc.exe`. Linux and MacOS uses just need to use a single slash `/`__

> [!TIP]
>Please turn off loop mode in VLC otherwise if the song queue runs out you will have to listen to the whole playlist again before you get to the new ones
